        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious dish features crispy breaded chicken covered with flavorful tomato sauce and melted mozzarella
            and Parmesan cheeses.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>A few fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>Dip each chicken breast in the beaten eggs, then coat in bread crumbs. Make sure each piece is fully
                covered.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until
                it's golden and crispy on each side. This should take about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, cover each piece with the marinara sauce, then top with mozzarella and
                Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, which should
                take about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish the chicken Parmesan with fresh basil leaves and serve with your choice of side (pasta, salad,
                etc).</li>
        </ol>
