        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The Chicken Corn Soup is a soul-warming dish, brimming with the hearty goodness of tender chicken chunks and
            sweet corn kernels. Every spoonful of this soup offers a beautiful blend of textures and flavors, from the
            savory chicken broth base to the slight crunch of corn, and the delicate strands of cooked egg dispersed
            throughout. The addition of soy sauce and sesame oil infuses the soup with a subtle umami note, rounded off
            with a hint of spiciness from white pepper. Garnished with freshly chopped green onions, this soup not only
            presents an appealing burst of color but also introduces a refreshing crunch that contrasts perfectly with
            the smooth, thick soup. It is indeed a bowl full of comfort and nourishment.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (about 0.5 kg) boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>5 cups of chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup of fresh or frozen corn kernels</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of cornstarch (optional, for thickening)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of white pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of chopped green onions for garnish</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the chicken breasts and cut them into small, bite-sized pieces.</li>

            <li>In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Once boiling, add the chicken pieces. Reduce the heat
                to
                medium and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked through. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Add the corn kernels to the pot and continue to simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Then, slowly pour the beaten eggs into the soup, stirring constantly.
                The
                eggs should cook immediately upon hitting the hot soup, creating small, thin strands.</li>

            <li>If you want a thicker soup, mix the cornstarch with a little cold water until it forms a paste. Stir
                this
                into the soup and let it cook for a few more minutes until the soup thickens.</li>

            <li>Stir in the soy sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper. Taste the soup and add salt if needed.</li>

            <li>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with chopped green onions before serving.</li>
        </ol>
